                    So this is my final project here in coding temple, I'm very proud to create this website 
                    because I know I have improved immensely, aswell I picked this theme because I always loved the 90s aesthetics,
                    I have poured my heart and soul into this and I believe I've done well and hope to continue to grow as a developer.
